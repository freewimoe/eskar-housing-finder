## **Dataset Content**

The ESKAR dataset consists of **synthetically generated but market-research-based** Karlsruhe housing data, specifically engineered for European School Karlsruhe families. The dataset represents **300+ properties** across **16 major Karlsruhe neighborhoods**, with realistic characteristics derived from actual 2025 market analysis.

### **üîç Data Sources & Generation Process**

- **Market Research Foundation:** Property pricing based on actual 2025 Karlsruhe real estate market analysis
- **Geographic Accuracy:** Real coordinates and neighborhood boundaries for all 16 Karlsruhe districts
- **Price Modeling:** Per-square-meter prices derived from current market reports (‚Ç¨2,800-‚Ç¨4,800/sqm)
- **ESK-Specific Features:** Family suitability scores based on actual ESK community feedback and location analysis

**Dataset Generation Methodology:**
1. **Neighborhood Selection:** 16 actual Karlsruhe districts with real demographic and geographic data
2. **Price Modeling:** Market-researched price ranges per neighborhood with realistic variance
3. **Feature Engineering:** 20+ calculated features including ESK proximity, family amenities, and transport scores
4. **Quality Assurance:** Statistical validation to ensure realistic property distributions and price correlations

**Data Architecture:**
- **CSV Storage:** 300+ properties in `data/housing_data.csv` with 20 engineered features
- **API Framework:** Production-ready architecture prepared for real estate API integration (ImmoScout24, OpenData)

## **Business Requirements**

As an international family relocating to Karlsruhe for work at the European School, major employers (SAP, KIT, Ionos), or EU institutions, you need specialized housing recommendations that go beyond traditional real estate searches. ESKAR addresses the unique needs of internationally mobile families who must consider school proximity, community integration, and employer accessibility.

The client challenges include:
- Understanding which property attributes correlate with successful ESK family integration
- Predicting accurate property prices in an unfamiliar market
- Finding properties that optimize both work commute and school distance
- Identifying neighborhoods with existing international/ESK communities

**Business Requirements:**

* **BR1** - The client is interested in discovering how property attributes correlate with ESK family satisfaction and housing success. Therefore, the client expects data visualizations showing the relationships between property features and ESK suitability scores.

* **BR2** - The client is interested in predicting property prices for any house in Karlsruhe, with special emphasis on properties suitable for ESK families, to make informed purchasing/rental decisions.

* **BR3** - The client requires a user-friendly interface that allows for interactive exploration of properties, including an interactive map with ESK proximity visualization and a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the system based on user experiences.

## **Hypotheses and how to validate**

### **Hypothesis 1: Proximity Premium Effect**
**H1:** Properties closer to European School Karlsruhe command premium prices and higher ESK suitability scores due to convenience and community clustering.

**Validation:** Analyze correlation between `distance_to_esk` and both `price` and `esk_suitability_score` using Pearson correlation and scatter plot visualizations.

### **Hypothesis 2: Family-Size Requirements**
**H2:** ESK families typically require larger properties (3+ bedrooms) with outdoor space (garden/balcony) due to international lifestyle and potential home office needs.

**Validation:** Compare bedroom count and garden availability distributions between high ESK-score properties vs. general market using statistical analysis and visualization.

### **Hypothesis 3: Community Clustering Effect**
**H3:** Neighborhoods with existing ESK families attract more ESK families, creating positive feedback loops and higher suitability scores.

**Validation:** Examine relationship between `current_esk_families` and `esk_suitability_score` through correlation analysis and neighborhood-level aggregation studies.

## **The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks**

* **Business Requirement 1:** Data visualization and correlation analysis
  - **Rationale:** We will inspect the housing data to understand which property attributes most strongly influence ESK family satisfaction and integration success
  - **Data Visualizations:** Correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, distribution plots for key features vs. ESK suitability scores
  - **Validation:** Statistical correlation analysis, feature importance ranking

* **Business Requirement 2:** Regression analysis and predictive modeling  
  - **Rationale:** We want to predict property prices to help ESK families make informed housing decisions
  - **ML Task:** Supervised learning regression model to predict property prices based on location, size, features, and ESK-specific criteria
  - **Target Variable:** Property price in Euros
  - **Features:** Property characteristics, location factors, ESK-specific metrics

## **ML Business Case**

### **Objective**
