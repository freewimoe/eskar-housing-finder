## **Dataset Content**

The ESKAR dataset consists of synthetically generated but realistic Karlsruhe housing data, engineered specifically for European School Karlsruhe families. The dataset represents **200+ properties** across **16 major Karlsruhe neighborhoods**, optimized for international families working at major local employers (SAP, KIT, Ionos, Research Centers).

### **🗺️ Interactive Map Features** 
**One of the project's standout features is the interactive Folium map integration that provides:**
- **Real-time property visualization** with location markers
- **ESK proximity analysis** with distance-based color coding  
- **Click-to-explore** property details and suitability scores
- **Dynamic filtering** by price, features, and neighborhood
- **Geographical insights** for optimal housing selection

## **Business Requirements**

As an international family relocating to Karlsruhe for work at the European School, major employers (SAP, KIT, Ionos), or EU institutions, you need specialized housing recommendations that go beyond traditional real estate searches. ESKAR addresses the unique needs of internationally mobile families who must consider school proximity, community integration, and employer accessibility.

The client challenges include:
- Understanding which property attributes correlate with successful ESK family integration
- Predicting accurate property prices in an unfamiliar market
- Finding properties that optimize both work commute and school distance
- Identifying neighborhoods with existing international/ESK communities

**Business Requirements:**

* **BR1** - The client is interested in discovering how property attributes correlate with ESK family satisfaction and housing success. Therefore, the client expects data visualizations showing the relationships between property features and ESK suitability scores.

* **BR2** - The client is interested in predicting property prices for any house in Karlsruhe, with special emphasis on properties suitable for ESK families, to make informed purchasing/rental decisions.

* **BR3** - The client requires a user-friendly interface that allows for interactive exploration of properties, including an interactive map with ESK proximity visualization and a feedback mechanism to continuously improve the system based on user experiences.

## **Hypotheses and how to validate**

### **Hypothesis 1: Proximity Premium Effect**
**H1:** Properties closer to European School Karlsruhe command premium prices and higher ESK suitability scores due to convenience and community clustering.

**Validation:** Analyze correlation between `distance_to_esk` and both `price` and `esk_suitability_score` using Pearson correlation and scatter plot visualizations.

### **Hypothesis 2: Family-Size Requirements**
**H2:** ESK families typically require larger properties (3+ bedrooms) with outdoor space (garden/balcony) due to international lifestyle and potential home office needs.

**Validation:** Compare bedroom count and garden availability distributions between high ESK-score properties vs. general market using statistical analysis and visualization.

### **Hypothesis 3: Community Clustering Effect**
**H3:** Neighborhoods with existing ESK families attract more ESK families, creating positive feedback loops and higher suitability scores.

**Validation:** Examine relationship between `current_esk_families` and `esk_suitability_score` through correlation analysis and neighborhood-level aggregation studies.

## **The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualizations and ML tasks**

* **Business Requirement 1:** Data visualization and correlation analysis
  - **Rationale:** We will inspect the housing data to understand which property attributes most strongly influence ESK family satisfaction and integration success
  - **Data Visualizations:** Correlation heatmaps, scatter plots, distribution plots for key features vs. ESK suitability scores
  - **Validation:** Statistical correlation analysis, feature importance ranking

* **Business Requirement 2:** Regression analysis and predictive modeling  
  - **Rationale:** We want to predict property prices to help ESK families make informed housing decisions
  - **ML Task:** Supervised learning regression model to predict property prices based on location, size, features, and ESK-specific criteria
  - **Target Variable:** Property price in Euros
  - **Features:** Property characteristics, location factors, ESK-specific metrics

## **ML Business Case**

### **Objective**
Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts Karlsruhe property prices while incorporating ESK-specific optimization factors to serve international families' unique housing needs.

### **Success Metrics**
- **R² Score ≥ 0.85** for price prediction accuracy
- **Mean Absolute Error ≤ €50,000** for practical utility  
- **Model interpretability** through feature importance analysis
- **User satisfaction** through feedback collection system

### **Model Selection Rationale**
- **Primary Model:** Random Forest Regressor for robust performance and interpretability
- **Features:** Property characteristics, location factors, ESK-specific metrics

### **Business Impact**
- Reduce housing search time for ESK families by 60%
- Improve housing satisfaction through data-driven recommendations  
- Support ESK community growth through optimized geographic distribution
- Provide transparent pricing insights for international families new to Karlsruhe market

### **Ethical Considerations**
